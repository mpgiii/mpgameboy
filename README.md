# The MPGameBoy emulator

A side project I began working on in October of 2022. My goal for this project
is to better learn how CPU architecture works, as well as brush up knowledge
on hexadecimal math.

The project currently is not functioning. I will continue to work toward an
eventual release (my first goal is to get a game to boot).
